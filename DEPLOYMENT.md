# üöÄ Deploying Your Todo List to GitHub

Follow these steps to deploy your todo list application to GitHub and make it available online for free!

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository `todo-list` (or any name you prefer)
4. Make sure it's set to "Public" if you want to use GitHub Pages for free
5. Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Initialize Git and Push Your Code

Open a terminal in your project directory and run these commands:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Create your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Todo List application with Material-UI"

# Add your GitHub repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Note**: Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username!

## Step 3: Update Configuration

Before deploying, update the following files with your GitHub username:

### 1. Update `package.json`
Change the homepage URL in `package.json`:
```json
"homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/todo-list"
```

### 2. Update `README.md`
Replace placeholder URLs with your actual repository links.

## Step 4: Deploy to GitHub Pages

Run the deployment command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will:
- Build your application
- Create a `gh-pages` branch
- Deploy the built files to GitHub Pages

## Step 5: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Select "gh-pages" branch and "/ (root)" folder
6. Click "Save"

## Step 6: Access Your Live Site

Your todo list will be available at:
`https://yourusername.github.io/todo-list`

It may take a few minutes for the site to become available.

## üîÑ Updating Your Deployed Site

Whenever you make changes to your code:

1. Commit your changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push origin main
```

2. Redeploy:
```bash
npm run deploy
```
